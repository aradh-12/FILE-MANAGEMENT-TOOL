🧪 Sample Interaction
=== File Management Tool ===
1. Write to File
2. Read from File
3. Append to File
4. Exit

Enter your choice: 1
Enter text to write to the file: Hello Codetech
Data written successfully.

Enter your choice: 3
Enter text to append: This is Task 1!
Data appended successfully.

Enter your choice: 2
Contents of the file:
Hello Codetech
This is Task 1!

🌍 Real-World Use Cases
📚 Learning Tool – Ideal for beginners in file I/O and stream operations
🔧 Utility Scripts – Create basic data manipulation scripts
🧪 Prototyping – Build quick CLI prototypes using file handling
📁 Log Management – Store logs or input/output operations
🧑‍💻 Interview Prep – Strengthen concepts of file streams and I/O handling
🧠 Architecture & Logic Flow


📌 Program Flow
User selects an operation from the menu
Based on selection:
Input is taken and written/appended using ofstream
File is read using ifstream
Errors are handled gracefully
Loop continues until exit command is given


📊 Performance & Design
⚡ Efficient – Minimal runtime and quick compilation
🎯 Lightweight – No external dependencies
🛡️ Robust – Prevents invalid file access and handles edge cases
👨‍💻 Simple UI – Easy to interact with, even for beginners



🔧 Configuration & Customization
📝 Change Target Filename – Modify "managed_file.txt" in the source code
🧱 Extend Functionality – Add support for file deletion or search
🎨 Customize UI Prompts – Update messages and labels for branding



🧪 Testing Guidelines


✅ Manual Testing
Compile and run the tool
Provide different types of input
Verify contents of managed_file.txt after each operation
Check for edge cases like empty input or invalid file access


🚧 Future Enhancements
📁 Support for multiple files
🗑️ File deletion and rename options
🧃 GUI wrapper using Qt or similar framework
